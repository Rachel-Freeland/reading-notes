|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
|Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Non-relational Databases |
| Table-based | Document-based |
| Have a Pre-defined schema | Have a Dynamic schema |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Not very good for hierarchical data storage | Better for hierarchical data storage |

    - SQL is good for data stored in tables
3. Give a real world example.
    - A companyâ€™s inventory

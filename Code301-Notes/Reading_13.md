# Reading for Day 13:

## Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](<https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding>)

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    - Personal computers started showing up in homes and were mostly marketed towards boys and men. (***I actually remember this.***) This is what
    defined what a geek was and started the techie trend. Even though girls expressed interest in computers, families used gender stereotyping and would more
    likely by a computer for a male child than a female child.

    I was fortunate enough that my mom had taught my dad that women can do things men can do and still remain
    women. My father is actually the one that caught me on his computer playing a game not meant for me. He asked how I got into the game... I showed him and
    he decided that I should go to school for computers. That was in 1988/89.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    - This lead many computer science professor to assume that their students had grown up playing on computers at home. This lead many women to find themselves
    far behind those of their male counterparts. This often led to women dropping from their computer classes and finding a different major.

## Review the data: [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](<https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/>)

1. What 3 take-aways do you have looking at this data?
    1. In each year in the chart: the 50 companies were closer to a 50/50 or 60/40 split genders. The more women involved, the more likely they were to perform
    better.
    2. When companies represent the population in general and are more diverse, they tend to perform better.

## Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company?](<https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/>)

1. When are most diversity efforts most successful?
    - When they are driven by a meaningful commitment from company leaders.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
    - Diverse groups of people bring a different view to organizations helping them to see problems in different ways.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice-versa.
    - When companies more closely represent their target base, or desired users, they can taylor their product better to that group. Like the example used in the article,
    when YouTube didn't take into consideration the left-handed users that would be using their product on an iPhone, it lead to videos that were uploaded upside down.

# Day 1 Reading Notes from:

- [Component Based Architecture](<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm>)

    1. What is a component?
        - A component is a reusable piece of code that is encapsulated within its own set of functions and is exported to be used in other interfaces.
    2. What are the characteristics of a component?
        - Components are:
            1. <b>Reusable</b> - designed to be reused however, there are some that do have a specific task
            2. <b>Replaceable</b> - can be substituted with other similar components
            3. <b>Not Context Specific</b> - should be able to operate in different environments or contexts
            4. <b>Extensible</b> - has the ability to be extended from other components to provide a new behavior
            5. <b>Independent</b> - designed to have little to no dependencies on other components
    3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
        - Ease of deployment
        - Reduced cost
        - Ease of development
        - Reusable
        - Modification of technical complexity
        - Reliability
        - System maintenance and evolution
        - Independent

- [What is Props and How to Use it in React](<https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child>)

    1. What is 'props' short for?
        - Properties
    2. How are props used in React?
        - To pass data between components
    3. What is the flow of props?
        - The flow is uni-directional (one-way) from parent to child

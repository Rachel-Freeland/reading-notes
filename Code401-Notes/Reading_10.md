# What are ***Stacks*** and ***Queues***?

## What is a ***Stack***?

Stacks are data structures that are made up of `Nodes`.

Common methods for working with Stacks:
* ***Push*** - Nodes are ***pushed*** onto the Stack. Will always be an O(1) time performance.
* ***Pop*** - Removes a Node from the Stack. Will have an O(1) time performance.
* ***Peek*** - This is when you view the `top` Node's value in the Stack. Will have an O(1) time performance.
* ***isEmpty*** - Returns a boolean value to indicate whether the Stack is empty or not. Will have an O(1) time performance.

Stacks follow these concepts:
* FILO - First In Last Out
* LIFO - Last In First Out

## What is a ***Queue***?

Queues, like Stacks, are data structures made up of `Nodes`.

Common method for working with Queues:
* ***Enqueue*** - Adding items or Nodes to the queue. Will always have an O(1) time performance.
* ***Dequeue*** - Removes items or Nodes from the queue. Will have an O(1) time performance.
* ***Front*** - This is the 1<sup>st</sup> Node of the queue. 
* ***Rear*** - This is the last Node of the queue.
* ***Peek*** - This is used to view the `front` node. Will have an O(1) time performance.
* ***isEmpty*** - Returns a boolean value to indicate whether a Queue is empty or not. Will have an O(1) time performance.

Queues follow these concepts:
* FIFO - First In First Out
* LILO - Last In Last Out

# Reading Notes for Day #11

## Reading

- [What is Jupyter Lab? - Overview](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
- [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

Jupyter Lab is a tool for interactive computing that integrates documents and activities together allowing:

- Code Consoles: a transient scratchpad for running code
- Kernel-backed documents: enables oede in any text file to be run
- Outputs can be mirrored to their own tab
- Allows for multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers for live editing of documents


## Videos

- Watch the video to `What is Jupyter Lab?`

Special keys for navigating the Jupyter Lab notebook:
* `-` and `=` Zoom In / Out
* `[` and `]` to rotate Left / Right
* `0` to reset
* Use the up and down arrow keys to move around in the notebook
* 
* Jupyter has 2 modes:
  * Command / Edit command mode is the default when opening the notebook
  * 

***Very cool to note: An example of a use of Jupyter was used that I am already familiar with!! At the beginning of the video,
an example use was the "auto-clusters tool" that we use for DNA and genealogy.***

***Randint***
This accepts 2 parameters: a lowest and a highest number. It returns a random
number

***Random***
Returns a number between 0 and 1. Can be converted to a larger number by multi-

### Risk Analysis

Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project brings potential problem areas to the forefront.

#### Risk Identification

1. Business Risks - this is the most common risk and it may come from your company or customer but, not from your project
2. Testing Risks - Know your tools
3. Premature Release Risk - what happens if you release unsatisfactory or untested software
4. Software Risks

### Risk Assessment

3 perspectives of Risk Assessment

1. Effect: Attempting to identify a condition, event, or action and try to determine its impact
2. Cause: this would be the opposite of "Effect". Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
3. Likelihood: The risk is probable that a requirement won't be satisfied.

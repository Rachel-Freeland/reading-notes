- [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

- Dunder - short for "double under" which refers to the "double undersore
- This article covers the:
    1. `__init__` - object initialization
    2. `__str__` and `__repr__` - object representation
    3. `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__` - iteration
    4. `__eq__` and `__lt__` - operator overloading for comparing accounts
    5. `__add__` - operator overloading for merging accounts
    6. `__call__` - callable python objects

## Videos

- [Intro to Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdHtK7CWpCQ)

Video by the fallen AI Guru, Sraj Raval. In this video, he demonstrates how AI and statistics can be used together to build better apps.
He discusses 3 different concepts that every data scientist needs to know.

1. Statistical features - One of the 1st things applied when exploring data for statistical purposes and it includes looking for things such as: bias, variance, mean, median, percentiles, etc
2. Probability distributions - a function that represents all types of values in an experiment
3. Bayesian statistics - all observed and unobserved parameters in a statistical model are given a joint probability distribution, termed the prior and data distributions.

This video talks about Saraj Raval's courses and how he had taken code form others yet, gave them no credit.

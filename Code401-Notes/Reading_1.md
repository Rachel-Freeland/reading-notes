Pain vs Suffering: With pain there is growth. With suffering, there is pain but, no growth.

***O(1)***

- Describes an algorithm tht will always execute in the same time(or space) regardless of the size of input data.

***O(N)***

- Describes an algorithm whose performance grows linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

***O(N<sup>2</sup>)***

- Represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. Usually involves nested iterations.

***O(2^N)***

- Indicative of an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.This is exponential growth. Example of an O(2^N) fuction is a recursive function

***O(log N)***

- Describes an iteration that halves the data sets like that of a binary search

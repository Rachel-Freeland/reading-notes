`Encryption` is the method by which you convert a message or some other information into a secret code to hide its true 
meaning. To decrypt the message, you wil need the secret key. <br>
`Decryption` is the process by which you convert an encrypted message, through use of the secret key, back to its 
original state. <br>
`Code cracking / Hacking` is the uncovering of the data without knowledge of the secret key by using a variety of 
techniques and / or tools. <br>
`Caesar cipher` is one of the simplest encryption techniques... you most likely played with it a bit as a child. The 
Caesar cipher is the shifting of the alphabet by so many letters to create and then aligning the correctly ordered alphabet
with the cipher to be able to encrypt and decrypt "secret messages."<br>
***The Caesar cipher is the basis for some of the more complex encryption schemes, such as, Vigen√®re cipher.***

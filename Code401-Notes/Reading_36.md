From Whiteboard advice: <br/>
Communicate, communicate, communicate!
1. Restate the question and seek affirmation. By restating the problem, you are verifying that you understand what 
   is being asked of you.
2. Ask about EDGE cases. Verify inputs and expected outputs.
3. Ask about TEST Cases. Are there any test cases your function should pass? ***Your interviewer will be expecting 
   you to ask this question!!***
4. Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense. ***Do not try to write actual code... yet!*** This is because you could 
   get 
   tripped up on trying to remember the methods or idiosyncrasies of the language rather than coming up with the 
   correct logic.
5. Write the actual code and ask if it looks good. 
6. Stuck?? Ask for help! Asking for help is not out of the question... just phrase it conversationally.
7. Communicate prior to the interview. Ask them, what type of interview will this be? Will there be a coding portion 
   of the interview? Is there anything special you should be prepared for. It is common to ask these questions, and 
   you should.

From 7 Tips:
1. Take a few minutes. Don't jump right into talking to fill the silence. Think through the basics of the problem, 
   and decide on an approach.
2. Write down the general steps of the solution on one side of the whiteboard. (Where it is still visible but, not 
   in the way)
3. Write pseudocode first. Just verify that your logic is correct.
4. Don't sweat the small stuff. Technical interviews are about demonstrating your depth and breadth of knowledge... 
   not the missing semicolon. If you can't remember something, it is often acceptable to say that you would look it up.
```text
“…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t 
remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding 
this.”
```
5. Sit down. Be humble.
   1. Are you able to express you ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
   2. Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
   3. How do you accept criticism?
   4. Are you able to collaborate with other to come up with solutions?
   5. Do yo communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
   6. Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
6. Come prepared.
7. Review your work.
   1. Scrutinize the efficiency of your algorithm
   2. Check over your work

## Reading

-[In Tests We Trust](<https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932>)

- This article discusses Unit Tests and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Unit tests put your code through excersizes in order to evaluate the behavior of your code
- With TDD, testing comes first
  - Testing naming convention:
    1. Be descriptive
    2. State what is expected
    3. State what we are testing
  - Test file name should follow the naming convention of the module
  - Testing structure should follow the AAA principle: ***Arrange, Act, and Assert***
    - Arrange: organize the data needed
    - Act: run the code being tested
    - Assert: check your results

-[If name equals main](<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/>)

- If a module is being run as the main program, it's special `__name__` value will be set to `__main__`
- If a module is being imported in then, the special `__name__` value will be set to the name of the script or module

-[Recursion](<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/>)

- Recursion is where a function calls itself, whether directly or indirectly
- The idea is to use a smaller problem to solve a larger one, such as, n * factorial(n - 1)

In this video, we are given a visual of how recursion works with a small problem.

## Reading

-[In Tests We Trust](<https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932>)

- This article discusses Unit Tests and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Unit tests put your code through excersizes in order to evaluate the behavior of your code
- With TDD, testing comes first
  - Testing naming convention:
    1. Be descriptive
    2. State what is expected
    3. State what we are testing
  - Test file name should follow the naming convention of the module
  - Testing structure should follow the AAA principle: ***Arrange, Act, and Assert***
    - Arrange: organize the data needed
    - Act: run the code being tested
    - Assert: check your results
